It will take data from a variety of sensors/sources and dump to a variety of outputs.\r\n\r\nIt is fully plugable in all directions.\r\n\r\n* input sources\r\n* protocol to process\r\n* outputs\r\n\r\n## Input Sources\r\n\r\nThis can be a variety of things, you just need to write the source plugin.\r\n\r\n* Read from a serial port\r\n* consume an external API (eg: weather data)\r\n* read from a unix socket\r\n* read from a tcp socket\r\n* ??\r\n\r\n## Protocols\r\n\r\nEach source you want to work with will implement their own data format - xml, json, csv or some custom format.  \r\nYou just need to write a protocol plugin for processing the raw data feed.\r\n\r\n## Outputs\r\n\r\nEdld uses the 'Observer' software design pattern to make it easy to notify more\r\nthan one 'observer' or 'notifier' when new data is recieved.  \r\nThis means that you just need to write an output plugin that takes the data and\r\ndoes something with it and register it in the config file.\r\n\r\n* stores in a db\r\n* sends offsite to thirparty api\r\n* sends to graylog2, logstash, splunk logging system\r\n* drops data onto some sort of message bus (amqp etc)\r\n* ??\r\n\r\n### Goals\r\n\r\nThe immediate goal is to be able to retrieve data from my [Current Cost Envir](http://www.currentcost.com/product-envir.html) and dump into a db.  \r\nLong term goal is to be able to read data from almost anything and to send it to almost anywhere.\r\n\r\n* ease to get up and running\r\n* easy to contribute / extend\r\n* extremely flexible\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\n\r\nSee [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\n### Licence\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)  \r\nCopyright 2014  \r\nMick Pollard [@aussielunix](http://twitter.com/aussielunix)\r\n\r\nSee [LICENSE](LICENSE.md)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
